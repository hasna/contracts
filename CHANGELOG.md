# Changelog

All notable changes to `@hasna/contracts` are documented here.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-24

### Service contract capability extensions (additive, v1)

- Add typed `serviceSurfaces` for API, SDK, MCP, and CLI, with class- and
  profile-scoped waivers plus package export/bin conformance
  (`surface_matrix`, `surface_bindings`).
- Add SQLite/PostgreSQL storage-engine capability metadata, `.db` path
  validation, and live-Postgres test-gate metadata recorded (never executed)
  by conformance (`storage_capabilities`).
- Add product `hosting` stories (`user-hosted` / `hasna-saas`) and canonical
  `self_hosted` runtime placement; the legacy `self-hosted` spelling parses as
  a deprecated alias.
- `public_manifest_safety` conformance rejects secret/credential references,
  credential-shaped values, internal hosts, ARNs, and account IDs from public
  manifests, reporting only structural path + category (no value echo).

### Client transport hardening

- Reject leading-zero, zero, and out-of-range explicit ports before WHATWG URL
  normalization, preserving canonical DNS, IPv4, bracketed IPv6, loopback,
  default, and boundary ports.
- Fail closed on authenticated redirects: every 3xx is surfaced as a terminal
  `HasnaHttpError` so API keys, bearer credentials, headers, and bodies stay on
  the validated origin.
- Compose the cloud host from `HASNA_FLEET_API_DOMAIN` with a neutral,
  non-resolving placeholder fallback that marks the config `misconfigured`.

### Compatibility

- Existing v1 manifests remain schema-readable; the only intentional tightening
  is rejecting a declared non-`.db` SQLite path. Conformance is intentionally
  stricter than schema parsing and reports migration gaps without executing
  manifest commands.

## [0.5.3] - 2026-07-24

### Registry <-> git reconciliation (main was diverged from the published npm line)

Before this release, the git history and the npm registry had silently diverged and
**no git tags existed to anchor any published version**. This release reconciles the two
lines. Investigation of the published artifacts (via `npm pack`) established the following
ground truth:

- **npm `latest` was `0.5.2`** (published 2026-07-08), but its `package.json` `gitHead`
  (`591933033e0f9e252a8161ca61d05598613cca15`) **does not exist anywhere in the repo** — an
  orphaned / out-of-band build.
- **`main` was at `0.5.1`, a version that was never published.** npm jumped `0.4.2 -> 0.5.2`,
  skipping `0.5.0` and `0.5.1`.
- Comparing the published `0.5.2` tarball against a build of `origin/main`
  (`c61d6b4`) showed the source is **content-identical**: every emitted `*.d.ts` and the
  shipped `src/kit` templates match byte-for-byte, and the only real delta is the
  `CONTRACTS_PACKAGE_VERSION` constant (`"0.5.1"` on main vs `"0.5.2"` published). Remaining
  `dist/*.js` differences were pure build-environment noise (pnpm vs bun `node_modules`
  path comments in vendored code). **No product code was lost; `0.5.2` was `main` + a version
  bump, published out-of-band without a commit or tag.**
- The same pattern was confirmed for **`0.4.2`** (published 2026-07-06): content-identical to
  commit `e4baf61` (the `0.4.1` commit) except for the version constant. Also an out-of-band
  publish.
- Versions present in git but **never published**: `0.3.0`, `0.5.0`, `0.5.1`.

### Changed

- **Bumped version `0.5.1 -> 0.5.3`** so the package version is strictly above the published
  npm `latest` (`0.5.2`). `0.5.1` and `0.5.2` are intentionally not reused.
- **Synced `CONTRACTS_PACKAGE_VERSION` in `src/schemas.ts` to `0.5.3`** to match
  `package.json`. (This constant is a hardcoded literal that must be kept in lockstep with
  `package.json`; keeping them out of sync is what let the out-of-band builds ship a version
  the git history never recorded. See "Follow-ups".)

### Tags backfilled (registry <-> git anchors)

Annotated tags were created so every published npm version is anchored to a commit:

| npm version | git anchor | note |
|---|---|---|
| 0.1.0 | efcdd68 | exact version-bump commit |
| 0.1.1 | 3ca1644 | exact |
| 0.2.0 | 42ef93e | exact |
| 0.2.1 | a531712 | exact |
| 0.2.2 | e4d5b63 | exact |
| 0.4.0 | 42a1287 | exact |
| 0.4.1 | e4baf61 | exact |
| 0.4.2 | e4baf61 | out-of-band build; content-equivalent to 0.4.1 commit + version bump |
| 0.5.2 | c61d6b4 | out-of-band build; content-equivalent to main HEAD + version bump; original gitHead orphaned |

### Follow-ups (to prevent silent divergence)

- **Always `git tag vX.Y.Z` on publish** and verify the published `gitHead` resolves inside
  the repo before every future publish.
- Consider deriving `CONTRACTS_PACKAGE_VERSION` from `package.json` at build time (or a
  release check that asserts they match) so the constant can never drift from the published
  version again.
- Open PRs that target versions at or below this reconciled baseline (`#21 -> 0.5.1`,
  `#14 -> 0.4.2`, `#13`/`#7 -> 0.4.1`, and `#18 -> 0.5.3`) must be re-bumped **above 0.5.3**;
  `#22` and `#19` both claim `0.6.0` and collide with each other.
